I am currently a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. Simelys Hernández in the Catalytic Reaction Engineering for Sustainable Technologies (CREST) group at the Polytechnic of Turin (POLITO) since March 2022. From March 2024, I started a prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie individual fellowship at POLITO within the project [SuPERCO2-101104004](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101104004). Previously, I worked in the group of Prof. Núria López at the Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ, Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Tarragona, Spain) for FlowPhotoChem (grant ID: 862453). My research focuses on modeling electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction on transition metal catalysts. In 2020, I got his Ph.D. in Chemical Science and Technology at the Rovira i Virgili University under the cosupervision of Prof. Núria López and Dr. Rodrigo Garcia-Muelas. During my Ph.D., I carried out two short stayings at the University of Leiden (Prof. Marc Koper’s group) and at Avantium Chemicals BV (Dr. Klaas Jan P. Schouten’s group). Prior to my Ph.D., I got a M.Sc. in Physics at the University of Turin in 2017, with a thesis on photoelectrochemical cells developed at Chalmers University of Technology (Gothenburg, Sweden).
