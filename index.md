The use of fossil fuels has greatly increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels, driving climate change. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind power offer solutions for energy, most chemical production still relies on fossil fuels. The _Surface Polarization, Evolution, and Reconstruction for CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction_ project (SuPERCO2) aims to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into valuable chemicals like ethanol and ethylene using electrochemical cells.

SuPERCO2 targets the rational design of reproducible Gas Diffusion Electrodes (GDEs) for electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction (eCO<sub>2</sub>R) to ethylene, ethanol, and C<sub>3+</sub> hydrocarbons. Reproducibility is ensured by the creation of an open-source database to store experimental data on synthesis and eCO<sub>2</sub>R performance and a multiscale model accounting for both atomistic and mass transfer effects.

SuPERCO2 has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 101104004.
