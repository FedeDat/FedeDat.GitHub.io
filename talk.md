## Proposed activities

# Sustainable Goose Game (6-10 years, 1 hour, in-person)
Thematic Goose Game on circular economy, sustainability, and the environment. Teams of kids will compete on a circular board, trying to correctly answer the questions they find in each square. The dice will move them forward, while trap squares or help squares will send them backward or allow them to advance even faster until the “final question,” which will determine the winning team. Typically, 3-4 teams can play, each consisting of a minimum of two and a maximum of 5-6 players. During the game, players may be required not only to answer questions theoretically but also to draw or build molecules or perform small experimental games.
 
# Hunting for CO<sub>2</sub> around Europe (12-16 years, 1 hour, in-person)
Have you ever wondered how to fight climate change, but more importantly, why we should do it? Dr. Federico Dattila will talk about the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and how, at the Polytechnic University of Turin and around Europe, technologies are being developed to capture carbon dioxide and transform it—using water and renewable energy—into plastics, detergents, and fuels! After the presentation, the students will engage in a group challenge between startups. Who will create the best startup to turn the available CO<sub>2</sub> into the most valuable material? In fact, the participants, divided into teams, face off in the challenge of the century: reducing carbon dioxide! Each team must connect carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms using special rods (chemical bonds) to form molecules. Each molecule earns points, calculated based on its market value. At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins!

# Become a Wiki Master! (16-19 years, 1 hours, online or in-person)  
What is climate change? How do we tackle it? What is the electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>? Dr. Federico Dattila from the Polytechnic University of Turin will explain to the class the urgency of the fight against climate change and the technologies available to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. To ensure the knowledge is not lost, there will be a short workshop after the presentation where basic tools for creating [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) entries will be introduced, to increase the public’s access to scientific knowledge!
